# Prediction-of-air-quality
This project predicts relative humidity (RH) using a dataset of air quality sensor readings from an Italian city. Various models, including Random Forest and Polynomial Regression, were tested, achieving high accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning showed minimal improvement, and all features were used to enhance prediction performance.
